### project responsive portfolio

on the top left is the name and the right is the links to other html pages.
in the index content shows the informations.
in the portfolio the content area have a link to a game if click on "cat and cheese game" words other placeholder do nothing.
in the contact the content just shows the information about me and the bottom do not do anything since javascript not added.
the resonsive portfolio is most important when you change the browser size in width. it gets smaller as you make the browser smaller and there is a breakpoint at 767px where the navbar will stack up.


### problems come upon
col-md-8 in index.html file is missing a - which it turns out not working can't figuard out for a few days until I redo it and compare with the repo online.
the margin of the row between the content title and the content info works on my computer and after I push it to the repo and open it online not though my computer it did not work but everyother change did work, refresh maytimes still didn't work. After I close the browser and reopen somehow it worked again.
Takes a lot of change in rows and col of div.
