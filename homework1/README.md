# portfolio
project one

the index page is the picture of me and some info about me.
the link at the top right of the page is to link to other two html pages, which is portfolio and contact.
in portfolio it have a link to a game i make.
in contact it have my name and the email address i used.




# the main trouble run into
have trouble making name div on the left and link div on the right 
fixed it by both add a float css instead of one then it worked

have a lot of problems arranging div blocks. It just takes a lot of time to make them the way I want them to look

the background image of the bodypart div took me a long time to fix. I search online for syntax and examples I still can't make it work.
this is a very simple mistake just thinking wrong, keep thinking the file stating location where the html is at and not where the css file is at so it can not find my image.


# links that helped
have used (https://www.w3schools.com/css/) a lot in this project and also google to search.
used (https://stackoverflow.com/) a few time most used in image of the background since i needed examples.
