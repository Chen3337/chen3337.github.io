### this project 
When first open the page the todays date is listed below the title "work day scheduler".
There are nine textboxs and each row represents an hour starting 9am and ends 5pm.
Each textbox is colored gray to be in the past, red to be the time right now, and green to be in the future.
Enter the work schedule into the textbox according to the time and click on the lock to save it, so it will be there even if the page is refreshed.
The text can be changed if the click on the lock to save again.

### sites
(https://www.w3schools.com/) This site used to help with the point-event.

### problems
The spaces in the html changes the lock position is very weird. Later on find out that it is because it is a span and space will affect the position of a span like there is spaces.
