On the top left there is a link to the highscore page.
In the index page there is paragraph with the rule, on the bottom of it is a button named "start" click on it to start the quiz.
There are five questions and each question is set to be 15 seconds so 75seconds total. Each wrong answer will result in 10 seconds subtract from the time. 
There are four choices to each question click on the button to submit the answer, below the choices will tell you if you got it right or wrong the question before.
After answering all five questions or when the time is up, it will get you to the submit your score page with your score shown. You will have to enter a initial or else it will not submit.
